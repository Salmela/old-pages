<div class="section">
<h1 style="display:none;">Front page</h1>
<div id="frontpage-gallery"><div class="title"></div><div class="image"></div></div>
<p>I did this page as part of the freely choosable work in april of 2011. The intention of this page was to try out cool features of HTML5 and CSS3. There was only 8 hours of time to do this, so I did it little bit at home. I decided that this page must be viewable on all browsers even on Intrnet Explorers.
